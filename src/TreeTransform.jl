Given a data structure (`data`) that does not contain cycles, we
apply a given transformation function (`xform`) at every node, and
return a new data structure with all possible transformations
applied.  Note that the result is a data structure in which every
node is a fixed-point of the transformation function provided.

There are two strategies for reaching the fixed-point.  One strategy
is recursive, by postorder traversal; we first find the fixed-point
of each child (recursively), and then repeatedly apply transformations
to the parent node until it is a fixed-point.  The other strategy is
iterative, by topological sort; we process nodes one by one from
the leaves to the root, and repeatedly apply transformations to each
node until it is a fixed-point.  In either case, when the transformation
function produces a new node, we apply the transformation function to
the new node as well using the recursive strategy.  We use a cache so
that once we have computed the fixed-point of a node, we do not need
to recompute it.

By default, we do not detect cycles in the applied transformations.
There are two kinds of cycles that can occur: first, if some sequence
of transformations result in the same data structure.  Second, if
the transformation function produces additional nodes that were not
in the previous data structure, and additional rules apply to the
new nodes.

We offer two mechanisms to detect cycles.  First, we can detect the
simple cycles of the first kind automatically, but at additional
cost.  You can enable this by setting `detect_cycles` to `true`.
Second, you can give a limit on the number of transformations to
apply, per node, in the original data structure.  You can enable this
by setting `max_transformations_per_node` to a positive integer.  If you set
`max_transformations_per_node` to 3 and the original data structure contained
100 nodes, then we will throw an exception after performing a total
of 300 calls to the transformation function.

The `transform` function should take a single argument, the node
to transform, and return a transformed version of that node.  The
`transform` function should not modify the original node.  If no
transformation applies to a node, then the `transform` function
should return the original node.

The nodes of the data structure can be of arbitrary Julia struct
types, but the data structure as a whole must be a directed acyclic
graph, i.e., it must not contain cycles.  The implementation examines
the set of constructors of the nodes, and the set of fields that
correspond to the parameters of each constructor.  We only consider
constructors that are not vararg, have no keyword arguments, and
whose parameter names all correspond to fields of the node type.
We take the constructor(s) with the longest parameter list with
these properties.  We throw an exception if there are more than one
and they name different fields or in different orders. Finally, we
use such a unique order to determine the children nodes to which
we will apply the transformation function.  That constructor will
be called to rewrite the parent node if any transformed child is
different from the original child.

The implementation keeps track of which nodes have reached a
fixed-point, so that we can perform the minimum number of
transformations.  We also keep track of the number of transformations
applied to each node, so that we can detect cycles of the second
kind.

This facility is less general than the E-graph approach, but it is
(hopefully) more efficient and easier to use when it applies.  The
E-graph approach can handle cycles, but it is more expensive and
requires more work to set up. See also "Metatheory.jl: Fast and
Elegant Algebraic Computation in Julia with Extensible Equality
Saturation" by Alessandro Cheli, 2021, <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07888>
